## Overview

MuxCipher is a simple yet effective encryption and decryption tool built using Python's Tkinter library. It encrypts and decrypts plaintext using a Caesar cipher, providing a user-friendly graphical interface for easy text manipulation.

## ✨ Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts plaintext by shifting each letter by a specified key value.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts ciphertext by reversing the shift applied during encryption.
- **GUI**: A clean and intuitive graphical interface using Tkinter.

## 📚 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kalmux1/MuxCipher.git
    cd MuxCipher
    ```

2. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python muxcipher.py
    ```

## 🛠️ How It Works

MuxCipher utilizes the Caesar cipher, a simple substitution cipher that shifts the alphabet by a specified number of positions:

- **Encryption**: 
  - Takes a plaintext input and shifts each alphabet letter by the key value specified.
  - Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.
- **Decryption**: 
  - Reverses the encryption process by shifting letters back by the same key value.
  - Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.
